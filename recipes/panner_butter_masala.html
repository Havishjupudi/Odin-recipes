  <p><strong>Paneer Butter Masala</strong>, also known as <strong>Paneer Makhani</strong>, is a popular North Indian vegetarian dish. It consists of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cubes cooked in a rich and creamy tomato-based gravy. The gravy is typically flavored with a blend of spices, butter, cream, and sometimes cashew nuts to create a flavorful and mildly spicy dish. Paneer Butter Masala is known for its creamy texture and a balance of tangy and mildly sweet flavors, making it a favorite in Indian cuisine. It is often served with naan, roti, or rice.</p>
